## Story

As a support lead, I want to get a daily digest of open tickets in Slack.

## Acceptance criteria

#### Scenario: Get a daily digest of open tickets in Slack
- **WHEN** it is 9:00 on a weekday
- **THEN** the open tickets are posted in #support by level

> [!owner] Frozen at 2. ToDo
> The agent may draft these sections; the owner approves them. After approval nobody edits them.

## Story

As <who>, I want <what>, so that <why>.

## Acceptance criteria

#### Scenario: <name>
- **WHEN** …
- **THEN** …

## Spec delta

What changes in the specs, grouped by spec, or exactly one line: `No behavior change: <why>`. When the story
ships, each delta is merged into its spec (a spec it names that does not exist yet is created).

### [[SPEC-<n> <Capability>]]

#### ADDED Requirements

##### Requirement: <name>
The system SHALL …

###### Scenario: <name>
- **WHEN** …

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.1 …

## Execution

Dated log from the first commit: what each commit did (sha), every departure from the tasks and why.

- 2026-11-09 — 

## Verification

- [ ] Every acceptance scenario has a test that exercises it
- [ ] Tried to break it on purpose; what was tried
- [ ] Docs the user reads are up to date (README, user guide)

**Verdict:** PASS · CONCERNS · FAIL — by … on … @ `sha`

## Result

The verified final state, with sha and the command output that proves it.

### Integration

Source branch, target branch, merge sha, release (`changelog_ref`).
