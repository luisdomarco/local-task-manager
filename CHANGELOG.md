# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are written down here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-20

- The description editor and the create form colour Markdown as you type, as Docs already did: headings, bold and
  italic, links, quotes and `code`. The marks stay visible; **View** shows it rendered.
- A fenced block that names its language (```` ```python ````, ```` ```js ````, ```` ```sh ````…) is coloured in that
  language, in the editor and in Docs.
- Full screen scrolls the coloured editor as a whole, the colours following below the fold.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-20

The first public release.

- Markdown vaults in two structures: **folder per type** and **Ticketing** (projects as folders), with a sample of each.
- Inbox capture with tokens, Today / Tomorrow / Week planning, a Board, lists per type and pages for initiatives and
  projects, with what hangs from them in tabs.
- Favourites in the sidebar, labels and people, comments with mentions, relations, pins and minimized cards.
- Work log per item and per day; Docs and an Explorer over the vault's files; ⌘K search.
- Claude Code on any item, in the embedded terminal or in Terminal, Claude Desktop, Cursor or Antigravity.
- A Mac app mode (`tools/install_app.py`), exports of the system and of a vault, a trash and atomic writes.
- Settings → Documentation, and a prompt that has Claude Code install the app.
